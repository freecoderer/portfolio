# 🔐 ISMS Certification Audit Coordination

## 📝 Overview
During my internship at **Equinix**, I took charge of supporting the **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** certification renewal audit for the **APAC region**, encompassing 12 countries. The project required close collaboration across time zones and strict adherence to audit standards.

## 🎯 Objective
To collect, review, and submit all necessary documentation (over 220 items) for ISMS certification renewal, ensuring compliance with Korea’s KISA and global security protocols.

## ⚙️ Responsibilities
- 🗓️ **Project Planning:** Created a timezone-based calendar to schedule meetings and stagger submission deadlines by region.
- 📑 **Documentation:** Collected and translated evidence, wrote improvement reports, and ensured consistency with ISMS control items.
- 🌐 **Cross-Cultural Communication:** Held weekly bilingual (Korean-English) syncs with stakeholders to clarify standards and maintain alignment.

## 🚀 Results
- ✅ Achieved **100% on-time submission** of audit evidence from all APAC regions.
- ⏱️ Minimized audit period disruptions with **zero severe penalties** during the 5-day KISA audit.
- 📈 Received positive feedback from the regional PM: *"Exceptional risk-resource management under tight deadlines."*
