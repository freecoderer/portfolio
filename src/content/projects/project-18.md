# Development of a Hair Loss Treatment Device Using Arduino

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a hair loss treatment device using Arduino. Hair loss is a significant issue for many, and this project aims to create a practical solution that combines Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) and traditional Korean medicine approaches to treat hair loss.

## Objective
To design and build a hair loss treatment device that is easy to use and effective. The device will incorporate LLLT to stimulate hair growth and use cooling fans to manage scalp temperature.

## Tools and Technology
- **Arduino Uno**: A microcontroller board for building digital devices.
- **LED for LLLT**: Used to stimulate hair growth through low-level laser therapy.
- **Cooling Fans**: To dissipate heat and maintain scalp temperature.
- **App Inventor**: For creating a mobile app to control the device.

## Project Steps

### 1. Problem Definition
Hair loss affects a significant portion of the population, with around 1.03 million people in Korea suffering from it. The social stigma and lack of insurance coverage for hair loss treatments exacerbate the problem. This project aims to address both the physical and social aspects of hair loss.

### 2. Problem Discovery and Confirmation
Observations in public spaces and statistics from the National Health Insurance Corporation indicated a rising trend in hair loss. News articles highlighted severe consequences of hair loss, including social discrimination and even crime. This motivated the development of a practical solution to treat hair loss.

### 3. Solution Approach
The project combines two approaches:
- **LLLT (Low-Level Laser Therapy)**: Using 808nm wavelength lasers to stimulate hair growth by increasing blood flow and metabolism in the scalp.
- **Traditional Korean Medicine**: Emphasizing blood flow and scalp health.

### 4. Design and Development
The device is designed as a cap incorporating LLLT LEDs and cooling fans.

#### Materials Needed:
- Arduino Uno (2 units)
- Cables (5 units)
- 9V Battery (2 units)
- Battery Connector (2 units)
- NeoPixel (1 unit)
- Motor Fan (1 unit)
- Arduino Motor Shield (1 unit)
- Cap (1 unit)

### 5. Assembly and Coding
The assembly involves integrating the NeoPixel LEDs and cooling fans with the Arduino. The LEDs are used for LLLT, while the cooling fans help manage scalp temperature.

### 6. Mobile App Development
The app, developed using App Inventor, connects to the Arduino via Bluetooth. It controls the operation of the LEDs and fans, providing a user-friendly interface for the treatment device.

## Completion and Reflection

### Final Output
The completed device successfully integrates LLLT and cooling functionalities, providing an effective and user-friendly solution for hair loss treatment.

### Personal Insights
This project fostered a deeper understanding of both technological and medical aspects of hair loss treatment. The practical application of Arduino in solving real-world problems was both challenging and rewarding.

### Future Directions
- Expanding the device to include additional sensors for more comprehensive scalp analysis.
- Enhancing the mobile app for better user experience and more functionalities.
- Conducting user trials to gather feedback and improve the device.

This project underscores the importance of innovative solutions in addressing common yet significant problems like hair loss. It highlights the potential of combining technology with traditional medicine to improve quality of life.
