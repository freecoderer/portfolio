# 📊 Translation QA Dashboard with Power BI

## 📝 Overview
While working as a Assistant Project Manager at **PTKOREA**, I developed a Power BI dashboard to **automate and visualize the QA process** for multilingual ad copy translations across global markets. This tool improved internal visibility, streamlined collaboration with translators, and reduced communication overhead for progress tracking.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔄 **Real-time Progress Tracking:** Automatically updates translation review status by market, language, and campaign.
- 📁 **Data Integration:** Connected to SharePoint and Excel sheets to pull task data with Power Query.
- ✅ **QA Completion Metrics:** Visual indicators for completed vs. pending reviews, categorized by priority.
- 📆 **Timeline View:** Gantt-style charts to show deadlines and review durations.
- 🚩 **Issue Tagging:** Highlighted translations with formatting or compliance issues for easy follow-up.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- 🧩 **Power BI Desktop**: Report and dashboard development
- 🧮 **DAX & Power Query**: Data modeling, transformations, and metrics calculation
- 📂 **Excel/SharePoint Integration**: Seamless data sync via cloud-hosted spreadsheets
- 🎨 **Custom Visuals**: Used conditional formatting and slicers for interactive filtering

## 🚀 Outcome
- 📉 Reduced manual reporting effort by 80% (from weekly Excel reports to live dashboards)
- 📢 Improved communication across global teams by centralizing all review progress in one visual space
- 🔍 Enabled managers to **quickly identify bottlenecks and overdue tasks**, leading to faster resolution
