# Project: Korean Mood Lamp using Arduino

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a Korean mood lamp using Arduino. The inspiration came from a previous project involving a Korean clock, and the goal was to create a modern, aesthetically pleasing mood lamp that incorporates the Korean language.

## Objective
To design and build a mood lamp that integrates Korean characters, using Arduino and NeoPixel LEDs to create a visually appealing and functional piece.

## Tools and Technology
- **Arduino Leonardo**: A microcontroller board for building digital devices.
- **NeoPixel LEDs**: Used to create the lighting effects.
- **Laser Cutting**: For precise cutting of the lamp design.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Cables**: For connecting components.
- **Adafruit NeoPixel Library**: For controlling the NeoPixel LEDs.

## Project Steps

### 1. Motivation
Having worked with Arduino for two years, the team was inspired by the clean design of a Korean clock created by Lee Ho-min. They decided to create a similar project that would not only be visually pleasing but also enhance their understanding of Arduino and NeoPixel LEDs.

### 2. Components
- **Laser Cutting Design**: Ordered from "Haekwang Laser," a workshop near Hongik University.
- **NeoPixel LEDs**: Purchased from an online store called Mechasolution.
- **Arduino Leonardo**
- **Breadboard and Jumper Cables**

### 3. Assembly Process (Hardware)
1. Assemble the laser-cut parts according to the design.
2. Attach the character plate to the assembled frame.
3. Inside the frame, connect the NeoPixel LEDs to the Arduino and breadboard.
4. Remove the unnecessary RTC module from the initial design.

### 4. Software Development
1. Install the Adafruit NeoPixel library.
2. Write the code to control the NeoPixel LEDs.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino.

### 5. Final Assembly
1. Compile the code and upload it to the Arduino.
2. Ensure the LEDs light up as intended, creating a soft and beautiful glow.

### Final Product
The mood lamp lights up beautifully, providing a warm and pleasant atmosphere.

### Reflection
Although the goal was to create a fully functional Korean clock, the technical challenges led to the creation of a mood lamp instead. The team is satisfied with the outcome and appreciates the learning experience. They hope this project will positively impact their future endeavors in software and hardware development.

### Future Directions
- Explore further integration of Korean characters into digital art and functional devices.
- Improve the design and functionality of the mood lamp.
- Develop more projects using Arduino and other open-source hardware.
