# 🕵️‍♂️ Forensic Project

During my exchange semester in Sweden, I embarked on a fascinating forensic project that remains one of my most memorable academic experiences. This project involved using a variety of tools to follow scenarios and identify suspects, bringing the fundamentals of digital forensics to life. The project was based on the book "Fundamentals of Digital Forensics," authored by our professor, which I meticulously studied throughout the semester. The hands-on nature of this course made it incredibly enjoyable and educational.


## 🔧 Skills and Tools Utilized

- **Kali Linux**: The robust platform we used for most of our forensic work.
- **Hashcat**: Essential for password recovery and cracking.
- **Autopsy**: A critical tool for digital forensic investigations.
- **FTK Imager**: Used for creating forensic images of data.
- **Volatility**: The core tool of our project, primarily used on Kali Linux for memory forensics.

This project was not only an academic endeavor but also a deep dive into the practical applications of digital forensics, providing me with invaluable skills and experiences that I carry forward in my professional journey.
