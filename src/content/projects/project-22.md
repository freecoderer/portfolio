# 🛍️ 11st Home Popup Planning

## 📝 Overview
The 11st Home Popup Planning project aims to create a dynamic, user-centric popup on the main homepage. Its core purpose is to deliver timely, personalised information to users—promoting key campaigns, events, and services while improving overall site engagement.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🎯 **Targeted Messaging:** Popups adapt based on user behaviour, seasonality, and marketing priorities.
- 📅 **Seasonal Campaigns:** Emphasis on highlighting based on customer informations.
- ♿ **Accessibility:** Designed with web accessibility principles (WCAG) to ensure inclusivity for all users.
- 💬 **Interactive Elements:** Banners, CTAs, and links guide users to relevant pages and promotions.
- 📱 **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing.

## 🎨 UX & Design Strategy
- Clear visual hierarchy and minimalistic design to avoid information overload.
- Animation cues and timed dismissals to keep the popup non-intrusive.
- A/B tested messaging and layout to determine most effective designs for user interaction.

## 🚀 Impact
- Improved click-through (approx. +15%) rates to promoted content.
- Increased awareness and participation in major campaigns.
- Enhanced first-impression UX for new and returning users.
