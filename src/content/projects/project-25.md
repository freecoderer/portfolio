## 📝 Overview
At **PTKOREA**, I contributed to the development of a QA automation tool built in Python, designed to validate translation accuracy and formatting across global advertising decks. My primary focus was on building a responsive and user-friendly **frontend interface** to present the backend's validation results clearly and efficiently.

## 🎯 My Role
- 🎨 **Frontend Development:** Built the interface using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, focusing on clarity, responsiveness, and accessibility.
- 🔍 **UX Design:** Designed user flows and feedback components to simplify review of large multilingual datasets.
- 🔄 **Translation Deck Integration:** Integrated frontend with dynamic translation deck inputs and validation result outputs.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- ⚛️ **Typescript**
- 🌀 **Tailwind CSS**
- 🛠️ **Axios & REST API**
- 🧠 **Python Backend (collaborated with BE devs)**
- 🔧 **Internal version control tools**

## ✅ Outcome
- Streamlined the translation QA workflow for both internal teams and external vendors.
- Reduced the time needed for manual formatting/link checks by introducing a structured visual validation flow.
- Improved stakeholder satisfaction through clearer dashboards and faster feedback cycles.
