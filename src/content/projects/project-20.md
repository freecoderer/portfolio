# Project: Competitor Popup Benchmarking Project at 11st

## Project Overview
During my tenure at 11st, I conducted a project to benchmark competitor popup implementations with the aim of improving the user experience and boosting sales. The project involved researching and analyzing how various e-commerce platforms utilized popups to deliver information and maximize promotional impact, then identifying the most suitable method to apply at 11st.

## Objective
- **Analyze competitor popup strategies**: Investigate banners, coupons, and event popups to uncover common UX/UI elements and marketing tactics  
- **Propose a plan for 11st**: Based on benchmarking findings, develop an optimized popup structure, design guidelines, and marketing strategy tailored for 11st  

## Tools and Technology
- **Analytics Tools**: Google Analytics, 11st internal data analysis tools  
- **Screenshot & Screen Recording**: Chrome extensions (e.g., Full Page Screen Capture)  
- **Project Management**: Jira/Confluence (or other collaboration tools like Asana or Trello)  
- **Data Organization**: Excel, Google Sheets  

## Project Steps

### 1. Motivation
- **Minimize user drop-offs**: Prevent site exits caused by excessive or unnecessary popups  
- **Increase sales**: Provide coupons and event notifications at opportune moments to boost conversion rates  
- **Gain a competitive edge**: Analyze proven popup approaches used by competitors to create a differentiated strategy at 11st  

### 2. Research and Benchmarking
1. **Selecting competitor sites**: Key domestic e-commerce platforms and international examples (Amazon, eBay, etc.)  
2. **Classifying popup types**:  
   - New user signup/login popups  
   - Discount coupon/time-limited deal event popups  
   - Cart-abandonment prevention popups  
3. **Analyzing UX/UI elements**: Popup frequency, size and position, color scheme and typography, close button placement, etc.  
4. **Examining real-world scenarios**: Reviewing popup usage across various user access points (PC/mobile/app)  

### 3. Implementation Plan
1. **Summarize benchmarking results**: Compile standout competitor examples with notable metrics (CTR, CVR, etc.)  
2. **Initial design proposals**:  
   - Basic popup layouts (banner-style, modal-style)  
   - Exposure strategy aligned with user stages (new visitors, returning visitors, specific event periods, etc.)  
3. **Test environment setup**:  
   - Conduct basic A/B testing in a QA or staging environment  
   - Expose a portion of real users to the new design, then gather performance data  

### 4. Data Analysis
1. **Pilot operation**: Implement selected benchmarked popup designs on the live site  
2. **Monitoring and metrics**:  
   - Track CTR (click-through rate), CVR (conversion rate), and bounce rate changes  
   - Analyze user flow from popup exposure through to checkout  
3. **Key insights**:  
   - Determine effective popup frequency and timing  
   - Identify design and content strategies that minimize user annoyance  

### 5. Final Output
1. **Finalize guidelines**:  
   - Popup designs customized for 11st (size, position, design elements)  
   - Event- and promotion-specific popup usage scenarios  
2. **Future project suggestions**:  
   - Personalized popups based on user interests and recently viewed items  
   - Automated popup deployment using machine learning (data-driven personalization)  

### Reflection
- **Collaboration experience**: Marketing, design, and development teams worked together, enhancing cross-departmental cooperation  
- **Practical impact**: Reduced site abandonment rates and increased promotion participation  
- **Room for improvement**: Limited technical resources restricted the scope of A/B testing  

### Future Directions
- **Enhanced personalization**: Develop automated popup recommendation systems driven by user behavior data  
- **Multi-channel integration**: Provide consistent user experiences by connecting popups with other channels (app push, web push, etc.)  
- **Ongoing benchmarking**: Continuously track domestic and international e-commerce platforms to stay on top of industry trends
