# My Journey in Technology and Innovation

Hello! I'm Kim Donghyun, an aspiring IT PMO and a passionate generalist who dreams of mastering every aspect of the IT ecosystem within a project. My journey through technology has been a mix of curiosity, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge, all aimed at creating solutions that bring happiness to users, support people's growth, and contribute to a better society.

My academic journey began at the Catholic University of Korea, where I pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. This foundation provided me with the technical skills and analytical mindset needed to thrive in the fast-paced world of technology. During my time at university, I had the incredible opportunity to study as an exchange student at the University of Skövde in Sweden, where I delved deeper into Information Engineering and experienced diverse educational approaches.

From a young age, I've always been fascinated by how things work, especially in the realm of technology. This curiosity led me to explore various programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C. I quickly realized that understanding multiple facets of technology would allow me to create more comprehensive and innovative solutions.

My passion for learning didn't stop at just coding. I ventured into web development using React, Node.js, and Express.js, and further explored database management with MongoDB and SQL. These experiences solidified my belief in being a well-rounded generalist, capable of tackling any challenge that comes my way.

Throughout my journey, I've been fortunate to work on several innovative projects that have shaped my skills and perspective. One such project is My Green, an interactive embedded web app system designed to monitor and manage plant health. Using Raspberry Pi and Flutter, I created a platform that allows users to engage with their plants in real-time, ensuring optimal care and fostering a deeper connection with nature.

Another project close to my heart is Zoop, a conceptual plogging app aimed at combining fitness with environmental sustainability. The idea was to encourage users to pick up litter while jogging, rewarding them for their efforts and creating a cleaner, healthier community. Although this project was primarily in the planning phase, it highlighted the potential of technology to drive positive social change.

My interest in cutting-edge technology led me to the Neo Trinity project, where I explored the potential of blockchain for enhancing security and transparency in campus rental and voting systems. By developing a decentralized platform with smart contracts and IoT integration, I learned how blockchain can create tamper-proof systems and automate processes, providing valuable insights into the future of secure digital interactions.

One of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences was the Risk Management project, where I applied ISO 27005 standards to identify, assess, and mitigate risks within an IT infrastructure. This international collaboration with students from Spain and Germany taught me the importance of structured risk management and the value of continuous monitoring to safeguard against potential threats.

My dedication and hard work have been recognized through various awards and achievements, including the Grand Prize at the Sejong City Job Competition and the Excellence Award at CUK - Time Attack. These accolades not only validate my efforts but also motivate me to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Beyond technical skills, I believe in the power of community and mentorship. As the President of LikeLion at Catholic University and an Executive Member of the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), I've had the privilege of leading teams, organizing events, and mentoring fellow students. These experiences have taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and inspiring others to achieve their best.

My journey through technology and innovation is driven by a passion for continuous learning and a commitment to making a positive impact. Whether it's developing new solutions, managing projects, or mentoring others, I strive to bring my best to everything I do. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to continuing to explore, innovate, and make a difference in the world of technology.

Feel free to connect with me on GitHub and LinkedIn. Let's create something amazing together!

Thank you for reading.
